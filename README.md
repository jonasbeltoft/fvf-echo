## üìñ Project Overview

**fvf-echo** is a project aimed at demonstrating the speed and efficiency of Golang when processing and displaying 10,000 rows of data that is also styled with CSS. The project leverages the following technologies:

- **Golang**: For fast and efficient backend processing.
- **Echo**: A high-performance, minimalist Go web framework.
- **HTMX**: A JavaScript library for enhancing user interactions without the need for a full-blown SPA framework.
- **HTML Templates**: For server-side rendering of dynamic content.

## üöÄ Getting Started

## üìä Benchmarking

This project processes and renders 10,000 rows of data to showcase Golang's speed and Echo's efficiency in handling large datasets with minimal latency. You can run your own benchmarks using Go's built-in testing tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Golang**: The main programming language used for backend logic.
- **Echo**: A fast and scalable web framework for Go.
